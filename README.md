# NextBestMove
Project One Group Three

Welcome to our app and brava for taking the first step on your new journey. 

We've all looked for work before, but none of these search engines can tell you the weather. We sought out to change that because if you're thinking about moving for work it's important to compare your current weather to the weather of the place you're considering moving to, like Topeka! This will give you the insight to the week ahead in Topeka and you can mentally compare it to the week in the place you live. Cheers!

Our deployement to Github Pages can be found at https://zzzbray.github.io/evenStevens/
